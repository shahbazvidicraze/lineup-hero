# Lineup Hero API

Lineup Hero API is the backend service powering the Lineup Hero application, a tool for creating and managing baseball and softball team lineups, optimizing player positions, and generating PDF lineup cards. This API is built with Laravel 11 and uses JWT for multi-auth (User and Admin).

    *   Admin management of promo codes (create, list, update, delete).
    *   User redemption of promo codes to activate team access.
*   **Application Settings:** Admin-configurable global settings (e.g., optimizer URL, prices, notification preferences).
*   **Email Notifications:**
    *   User welcome email.
    *   Password reset OTP email.
    *   Password changed notification email (for User & Admin).
    *   Payment success/failure notifications (for User).
    *   Admin notification for new payments (configurable).
*   **Admin Utilities:** API endpoints for admins to run migrations and seeders in controlled environments.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend Framework:** Laravel 11 (PHP 8.2+)
*   **Database:** MySQL (Recommended) / PostgreSQL / SQLite (for local dev)
*   **Authentication:** `tymon/jwt-auth` for JWT
*   **Payments:** Stripe PHP SDK
*   **Lineup Optimization:** External Python (Flask + PuLP) service (optional, can be replaced by heuristics)
*   **Mail:** Laravel Mail (configurable drivers like SMTP, Mailgun, Log, Mailtrap)
*   **Queues:** Laravel Queues (Recommended for mailing, potentially other background tasks)

## Prerequisites

*   PHP >= 8.2
*   Composer
*   Database Server (MySQL >= 5.7 or MariaDB >= 10.3, or PostgreSQL >= 10)
*   Web Server (Nginx or Apache)
*   Node.js & NPM/Yarn (if you plan to modify frontend assets, less critical for pure API)
*   (If using Python Optimizer) Python >= 3.9, Pip, and a PuLP solver like CBC.
*   Stripe Account (for payment integration)

## Installation

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahbazvidicraze/lineup-hero.git lineup-hero-api
cd lineup-hero-api
```

2. Install Dependencies
```bash
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev # For production
# OR
composer install # For development
```
3. Environment Setup
   Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit .env and configure the following:
APP_NAME, APP_ENV, APP_DEBUG, APP_URL
DB_CONNECTION, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD
MAIL_... variables for email sending.
STRIPE_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (use test keys for development).
OPTIMIZER_SERVICE_URL (URL of your Python lineup optimizer service if used).
Queue driver (QUEUE_CONNECTION), e.g., database or redis.
4. Generate Application Key
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```
5. Database Migration & Seeding
   Run Migrations: Create the database schema.
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
Run Seeders:
Populate the database with initial data (positions, settings, optional sample users/teams).
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```
This will run DatabaseSeeder.php, which should call PositionSeeder, SettingsSeeder, and OrganizationTeamPlayerSeeder.
The OrganizationTeamPlayerSeeder is designed to use existing users (e.g., created by User::factory() in DatabaseSeeder or your initial user setup) and build data for them.
6. Configure JWT
   Publish the JWT configuration (if not already done when installing tymon/jwt-auth):
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider"
```
Generate JWT Secret Key:
```bash
php artisan jwt:secret
```
Ensure your config/auth.php has the api_user and api_admin guards and providers correctly configured for JWT and your User and Admin models.
7. Configure Stripe
   Add your Stripe Publishable Key (pk_...) and Secret Key (sk_...) to .env.
   For local development, set up stripe listen to forward webhooks and get a local webhook signing secret for STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET.
   For production, create a webhook endpoint in your Stripe dashboard and use the live webhook signing secret.
   Ensure the webhook route (/stripe/webhook or /api/v1/stripe/webhook) is excluded from CSRF protection in app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php (Laravel <11) or bootstrap/app.php (Laravel 11+).
8. Configure Python Optimizer Service (If Used)
   Set up and run your Python Flask/PuLP service (see separate deployment guide for the Python service).
   Ensure the OPTIMIZER_SERVICE_URL in your Laravel .env file points to the correct URL of this running Python service.
9. Configure Mail
   Set up your mail driver and credentials in .env (e.g., SMTP, Mailgun, SES, Mailtrap for testing, or log driver).
10. Set Up Queue Worker (Recommended)
    For sending emails and other background tasks, set up a queue worker:
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```
For production, use a process manager like Supervisor to keep the queue worker running.
11. Configure Web Server
    Document Root: Point your web server's document root to the /public directory of your Laravel project.
    Rewrite Rules: Ensure proper rewrite rules are in place for Laravel (e.g., for Nginx or Apache .htaccess).
    Nginx Example Snippet:
```
server {
    # ... other server config ...
    root /path/to/your/lineup-hero-api/public;
    index index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        # ... fastcgi_pass to your PHP-FPM socket/port ...
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
}
```

## API Endpoints
All User and Admin routes (except public auth routes) require a JWT Bearer token in the Authorization header.
Refer to the separate "Lineup Hero API Documentation for Flutter Client" PDF/Markdown for detailed request/response examples for each endpoint.

### Python Lineup Optimizer Service
* This API relies on an external Python (Flask + PuLP) service for the "Autocomplete Lineup" feature.
* This service needs to be deployed and running independently.
* The URL for this service is configured via the OPTIMIZER_SERVICE_URL in the Laravel .env file (managed via the Admin Settings API).
* Refer to the Python service's own documentation/README for its deployment.
### Testing
* PHPUnit: Run unit and feature tests:
```bash
php artisan test
```
* Postman: A Postman collection can be used to test API endpoints. (Consider creating and sharing one).
* Stripe CLI: Use stripe listen --forward-to <your-local-webhook-url> for local webhook testing. Use stripe trigger <event> to simulate Stripe events.
### Deployment Notes
* Ensure APP_ENV=production and APP_DEBUG=false in your production .env.
* Use live Stripe keys and webhook secrets in production.
* Configure a robust queue worker (e.g., Supervisor + Redis/Database queue driver) for production.
* Set correct file permissions for storage and bootstrap/cache.
* Set up HTTPS (SSL certificate) for your domain.
* Deploy the Python optimizer service separately and ensure its URL is correctly configured in Laravel.
